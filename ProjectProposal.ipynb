    " It is recommended (and our intent) not to abuse or use the information in a malicious way that could hurt an individual or groups of individuals, whether physically or financially. That being said, these datasets are open source and can be viewed and used by the general public to conduct studies and/or research. While there doesn’t seem to be any information in the data that would be an immediate red flag such as names, or information relating to specific individuals, there could be potential problems with location(s) or source of location(s) of the bikes being ridden. This could include military locations or other government facilities that aren’t necessarily known to the general public and would potentially pose a threat if such information were in the wrong hands. As for biases towards a particular population, we can possibly see a trend towards more bike usage in affluent areas of the greater Los Angeles area, which also includes the downtown and industrial areas. As for handling of each of the individual problems that may arise from our datasets, we would treat each one differently. For location, we would likely have to scrap areas that showed high usage if near or on a government facility (such as a military base), but not something like a social security or HHSA office that would be deemed less of a potential threat. For biases in trends towards certain areas based on income, we may need to change or slightly alter our research question to include all areas within Los Angeles even if those areas see very minimal bike usage compared to others.\n"

    "\n",
    "We are predicting to see a direct correlation between bikes and safer neighborhoods.  The results of our analysis could support or refute our hypothesis in many capacities, and will most likely not have a full support or refute.  For example, we may see a direct correlation between bike lanes and rental prices, but also a correlation between those same bike lanes and the crashes.  In fact, actually quantifying a community can be a hard task unto itself.  Besides this, if bikes do have a significant effect on communities in LA, this may help a lot of people.  This may help city planners in decided where to put bike lanes or organize a space.  This may impact the industry of bikes, in creating a need that manufacturers may need to meet.  This comes in the form of stronger bikes, or better lights.  Lastly, this study could help change the health of people.  If we find positive and community uplifting factors in our analysis, this may be a potent weapon in helping people become their best selves.  \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, all of our analysis could totally refute our hypothesis.  This would mean that bicycles have no impact on communities.  This would be an interesting finding because it would give people and researchers a closer look at what really makes interaction or public space work.  The finding could apply to other domains such as scooters or other small mobility technologies.  We would do our best to structure our finding in a way that could help people, even if our hypothesis is disproved.  We would also take time to look over and revise our predictions.  If our methods are incorrect in the end, we will be completely honest with the pitfalls and misinterpreted information.  We will be honest with our findings and even more honest with sharing.  We will use the mishap to correct our process and future work.  Not meeting our prediction will not only provide an opportunity to learn, but to show others what impacts we actually found.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Our data processes a few pitfalls which are important to understand.  When we analyze crash data with bike lanes, it will be important to consider the complex situation that could create this situation.  There could factors such as, pedestrians, size of streets, signs blocking view, location of sun, and many others that play a part.  Correlation is not causation: we have to be careful when comparing two data sets.  Another pitfall that is important is the amount of bike crashes that go undocumented.  There is a lot of data that may be missing, so it will be important to not make sweeping assumptions about our results.  Lastly, we may run into physical with wrangling multiple government datasets together.  It may be confusing to pull together and analyze large data sets with similar dates, locations, and other features.  We hope to be honest with our results and humble when overcoming the problems we may run into. \n"
